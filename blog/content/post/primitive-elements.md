# Primitive elements in a Galois Field / $Z_p$

An element is primitive in a space $Z_p$, if it can be used to generate every number through its powers (mod p).

> A primitive element is a number (given Z_m) which, when raised to power mod m, gives all possible elements in Z_m

* GF(x) has phi(x-1) primitive elements
