Comma codes are codes with a common suffix that acts as a delimiter.  
A comma code of length `n` has `n + 1` possible codes.

For example, comma codes with the delimiter of `0`:

* `0`
* `10`
* `110`
* `1110`
* `1111`

We can simply assign each comma code to a source message.  
_i.e. s1 s2 s3 s4 s5_
